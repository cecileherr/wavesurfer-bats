## Wavesurfer for bat sounds (this repository)

From time to time I (will) add a few functions to the programme to facilitate analysis of bat sounds.

### Disclaimer: 

- I have more or less 0 knowledge of TCL/TK programming. Do not expect good examples of coding in this repository.
- Based on version 1.8.8p4
- Customizations developed and tested only on an old version of Mac OS X, use at your own risk.

### Added:

- 2 new colour scales red-green-blue
- buttons to navigate between sounds within a folder
- a new preference to close the current sound when navigating to the previous/next one or first/last one
- configuration files for bat sounds (Mac version)

### Will be added soon:

- spectrum section: select 'average of selection' by default
